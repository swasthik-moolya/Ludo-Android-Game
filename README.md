<h2>Interface</h2>
Ludo is a popular game to play on smartphones and tablets. When designing a Ludo game, it is essential to consider the target audience and their preferences. For example, if the game is aimed at children, the design should be colourful and engaging, with simple mechanics that are easy to understand. On the other hand, if the game is targeted at adults, the design can be more sophisticated, with complex gameplay mechanics. The game’s user interface (UI) should also be intuitive and easy to navigate. The buttons and controls should be placed in convenient locations, and the text should be easy to read. The game’s sound effects and music should also be carefully considered, as they can enhance the overall user experience.
